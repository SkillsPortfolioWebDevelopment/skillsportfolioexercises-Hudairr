    <h1>Few things to keep in mind:</h1>
    <p>Your active participation is required for effective therapy. It takes time, effort, and consistency.
        Keep the following suggestions in mind as you begin your therapy:
        <ul type="squared" style="font-size:17px">
            <li>Attend all of your appointments as scheduled.</li>
            <li>Set goals with your therapist right away. Review them on a regular basis.
                Determine the sources of stress. Try keeping a journal and writing down both stressful and positive events.</li>
            <li>Reset your priorities. Positive, effective behavior should be emphasized.
                Make time for enjoyable and recreational activities.</li>
            <li>Communicate. To someone you trust, explain and assert your needs. To express yourself, keep a journal.</li>
            <li>Concentrate on the positive outcomes and methods for reducing and managing stress.</li>
            <li>Be open and truthful. Your willingness to share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, as well as consider new insights, ideas, and ways of doing things, is critical to your success. Inform your therapist if you are hesitant to discuss certain issues due to painful emotions, embarrassment, or concerns about your therapist's reaction.</li>
            <li>Maintain your treatment plan. It may be tempting to skip psychotherapy sessions if you are feeling down or unmotivated. This can stymie your progress. Try to attend all sessions and think about what you want to talk about.</li>
            <li>Don't expect immediate results. Working on emotional issues can be difficult and painful. It may take several sessions before you notice any improvement.</li>
        </ul>
